# Ideas for the application

## Features

### Export to HTML

We could provide an export function that will create a new HTML file from the current building plan and clustering that is viewed in the web application.
The exported HTML should contain the full web application as well as the currently viewed building plan and clustering for easy sharing.

### Filtering

We could provide filtering by room metrics (more than 50mÂ² for example).

### Marking individual rooms

There could be a function to select or mark one or multiple rooms with a color (or alike).
